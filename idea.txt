Classified Ad site for students and Hostel Owners in Tertiary institutions.

Nigeria students in Tertiary institutions pass through untold  stress trying to find Hostels/Lodges that are within/outside their campus environment that meets their taste, comfort and  (depending on the student) finance,  they have to go from one hostel to another asking questions about different hostels they come across. secondly , Students in Tertiary institutions have difficulty selling their used item(s) within their campus/state knowing  fully well that there is someone(if not a fellow student) that is also looking for such product to buy within the state (or same campus), but due to the fact that their is no such medium for such students to interact , sell/buy their items that becomes a problem  that requires attention.



The solution to this problem is  creating a medium/platform (internet based) where private hostel/Lodge owners/agents  would post ads about their hostels, containing images of the rooms and also specifying the facilities that are available in the Hostel and also the price ,  location , rules  e.t.c every information whatsoever and also including their contact details for interested students.
This platform would also allow students to post ads of their used/new  products, specifying the information required such as price , condition , category , subcategory , school e.t.c students could also use this platform to market their products which in return will encourage entrepreneurism  among students.



I am the only one working on this idea for now, solving this problem is very important to me because of the fact that i've personally had these challenges when i was looking for accommodation within my school environment  the fact that i had to visit several hostels asking for the price, living condition, while this would have easily been solved if there was any platform where i could easily checkout hostels within my school environment, and also compare the prices and settle for the most appealing to me.
